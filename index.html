    </header>
    <p class="lead">
        In the world of film, the Thriller is a very broad category. As you'll see with my compiled "Classic Thriller Movies of All Time" list, it ranges 80 years and dips its toe in many other genres - horror, film noir, espionage, etc. I've done my best here to give you a grand sampling of suspenseful movies, a rundown that spans multiple decades, evokes different moods, and showcases many directors (though there are a few repeats). So here are the best thriller movies of all time, from grim, grinning ghosts, to serial killers, to brainwashed pawns of enemy nations.

                Guy Pearce, Joe Pantoliano, and Carrie-Anne Moss star in this inventive, backwards 2001 thriller from writer-director Christopher Nolan, 
                which tells the story of a vengeful man who suffers from short-term memory loss. Memento unfolds in ten-minute sequences, shown in reverse 
                chronological order, creating an experience that put Nolan on everyone's short-list, and turned Memento into one of the privileged
                few movies that become lexicon. Not only is it a great thriller film, it's also one of the best mystery thriller movies of all time.

                Even though everyone knows the big twist in The Sixth Sense now, M. Night Shyamalan's 
                breakthrough 1999 movie, starring Bruce Willis and Toni Collette, is still one of the
                best thriller movies that stands firm even without the shock and awe of its final moments. 
                Haley Joel Osment's journey as young Cole, a tortured boy desperate to find out why the dead 
                appear to him, is masterful storytelling, containing a meaningful message about embracing 
                that which terrifies you to discover the truth underneath.

                David Fincher's Seven (also "Se7en") brought ghoulish intelligence and jagged thrills to the oversaturated 90’s 
                serial killer movie game. A gorgeously dark suspense film, which unwraps the gory tale of a maniac punishing his 
                victims by exacting brutality based on the Seven Deadly Sins, Seven features Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman as an 
                uneasy detective duo on the cusp of having their worlds shattered forever.

            <p class="card-text">
                Featuring a strong, Academy Award-winning screenplay by Robert Towne,
                 Chinatown is an awesome, textbook neo-noir thriller that simultaneously pays
                 homage to and redefines the film noir genre. It follows private detective
                  J.J. Gittes (Jack Nicholson) as he investigates a murder and stumbles onto 
                  a conspiracy involving the future of Los Angeles. Telling a complex story 
                  brilliantly and showcasing brilliant performances by Nicholson and co-star 
                  Faye Dunaway, Chinatown has been on every best thriller/noir shortlist since
                  its 1974 premiere.

                Simply put, Psycho is one of the best and most influential suspense thrillers ever made and 
                one of the best horror movies. This 1960 Alfred Hitchcock classic starring Anthony Perkins
                 and Janet Leigh changed cinema and inspired countless future filmmakers in the process.
                  For Hitchcock — who had previously crafted films like North by Northwest, Vertigo and 
                  Rear Window — the film was a notable departure from his established formula. Filmed 
                  with a smaller budget, in black-and-white, by the crew of his television series
                   Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Psycho was controversial (at the time) in both structure 
                   and topic and now stands tall as one of the best movies of all time.

                        Memento premiered at the Venice Film Festival on September 5, 2000, and was theatrically released in the United States on March 16, 2001. It was acclaimed by critics, who praised its nonlinear structure and themes of memory, perception, grief, and self-deception. It was also a commercial success, earning $40 million over its $9 million budget and gained a cult following. Memento received many accolades, including the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award at the Sundance Film Festival, and Academy Award nominations for Best Original Screenplay and Best Film Editing.[8] In 2017, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.

                        A lot went into creating that vibe and making the movie unforgettable. These Se7en behind-the-scenes stories will reveal the actors who almost snagged the lead roles, the struggles of the performers who played the victims, the way the filmmakers took every precaution to make sure their challenging story wasn't compromised, and much more.
