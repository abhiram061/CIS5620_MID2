                In the world of film, the Thriller is a very broad category. As you'll see with my compiled "Classic Thriller Movies of All Time" list, it ranges 80 years and dips its toe in many other genres - horror, film noir, espionage, etc. I've done my best here to give you a grand sampling of suspenseful movies, a rundown that spans multiple decades, evokes different moods, and showcases many directors (though there are a few repeats). So here are the best thriller movies of all time, from grim, grinning ghosts, to serial killers, to brainwashed pawns of enemy nations.

                        Guy Pearce, Joe Pantoliano, and Carrie-Anne Moss star in this inventive, backwards 2001 thriller from writer-director Christopher Nolan, 
                        which tells the story of a vengeful man who suffers from short-term memory loss. Memento unfolds in ten-minute sequences, shown in reverse 
                        chronological order, creating an experience that put Nolan on everyone's short-list, and turned Memento into one of the privileged
                        few movies that become lexicon. Not only is it a great thriller film, it's also one of the best mystery thriller movies of all time.

                        Even though everyone knows the big twist in The Sixth Sense now, M. Night Shyamalan's 
                        breakthrough 1999 movie, starring Bruce Willis and Toni Collette, is still one of the
                        best thriller movies that stands firm even without the shock and awe of its final moments. 
                        Haley Joel Osment's journey as young Cole, a tortured boy desperate to find out why the dead 
                        appear to him, is masterful storytelling, containing a meaningful message about embracing 
                        that which terrifies you to discover the truth underneath.

                        David Fincher's Seven (also "Se7en") brought ghoulish intelligence and jagged thrills to the oversaturated 90’s 
                        serial killer movie game. A gorgeously dark suspense film, which unwraps the gory tale of a maniac punishing his 
                        victims by exacting brutality based on the Seven Deadly Sins, Seven features Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman as an 
                        uneasy detective duo on the cusp of having their worlds shattered forever.

                        Featuring a strong, Academy Award-winning screenplay by Robert Towne,
                         Chinatown is an awesome, textbook neo-noir thriller that simultaneously pays
                         homage to and redefines the film noir genre. It follows private detective
                          J.J. Gittes (Jack Nicholson) as he investigates a murder and stumbles onto 
                          a conspiracy involving the future of Los Angeles. Telling a complex story 
                          brilliantly and showcasing brilliant performances by Nicholson and co-star 
                          Faye Dunaway, Chinatown has been on every best thriller/noir shortlist since
                          its 1974 premiere.

                        Simply put, Psycho is one of the best and most influential suspense thrillers ever made and 
                        one of the best horror movies. This 1960 Alfred Hitchcock classic starring Anthony Perkins
                         and Janet Leigh changed cinema and inspired countless future filmmakers in the process.
                          For Hitchcock — who had previously crafted films like North by Northwest, Vertigo and 
                          Rear Window — the film was a notable departure from his established formula. Filmed 
                          with a smaller budget, in black-and-white, by the crew of his television series
                           Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Psycho was controversial (at the time) in both structure 
                           and topic and now stands tall as one of the best movies of all time.
